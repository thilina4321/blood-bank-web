        q:'Why Do you ask about health history ?',
      a:`Our donation criteria, and questions on the donor questionnaire form, are designed to ensure that the blood collection process is as safe as possible for blood donors and patients alike. 
      Our pre-donation screening includes a questionnaire made up of three sections. The first looks at the health history of first-time donors and the second is a medical questionnaire for all donors. These two sections are designed to identify possible medical issues in potential donors, as well as general risks of infection. 
      The third section is a legal declaration for you to fill out, pertaining to specific infection risks such as sexual activity and blood exposures. Some of these questions ask about ‘sexual contact’ and ‘sex’. We use these terms to refer to any sexual activities including vaginal, oral or anal.`

        q:'Is Lifeblood being discriminatory in making gay men wait 3 months to donate?',
      a:`No, our policy considers an assessment of risk, and does not discriminate against anyone. Postponements are in place for any number of potential donors who may be more likely to be exposed to infection or present other risks to patients. 
      The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has visited this issue, and agrees that we are not being discriminatory with our deferral policy for men who have sex with men.`

          id:3, 
        q:'Don’t you test blood for HIV?',
      a:`Yes, we test every donation. However, even this sophisticated testing is unable to detect the early presence of infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. We refer to this as a ‘window period’ – it’s a time when the infection is just starting and isn’t yet detectable. This is why we can’t rely on testing alone.`
       },
        {
          id:4, 
        q:'I’m in an exclusive relationship, why can’t I donate blood?',
      a:`We understand that there are different levels of risk among men who have sex with men. The latest information from the Kirby Institute (University of NSW) states that HIV continues to be transmitted primarily through sexual contact between men. Even within declared monogamous relationships, the risk is on average 50 times higher than in heterosexual couples.`
