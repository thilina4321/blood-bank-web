                Lifeblood is committed to the health of blood donors. Studies that follow donors over a longer period of time and assess the differences in health outcomes according to donor characteristics can help us find any long-term differences in health outcomes for particular groups. 
                
                In the Australian Blood Donor Study (ABDS) pilot phase, we’re testing this approach for research into long-term health and donation-related behaviour. In the pilot phase survey, we’re also asking donors how they feel about donating blood for biobanking and broader research purposes.

                des :` The coronavirus pandemic has changed many things that our Lifeblood donors previously took for granted.  
                Donating is just one activity affected by the pandemic. Donors have been asked to follow Lifeblood's own guidelines for donating, as well as keeping up with changing Australian emergency guidelines and restrictions for behaviour more generally.  
                These guidelines mean different things for different donors. We want to ask how they feel about donating during this time, and find out how it affects their donation experience and behaviour. Our findings will help us support donors and provide the information they need to continue to donate safely.

                In addition to our routine quality assays, our researchers are regularly using other state-of-the-art measurements to test red cells, platelets and plasma products at all our manufacturing sites. This testing allows us to monitor the effects of changing blood collection or manufacturing processes.

                des :`During storage, red cells sometimes become more fragile, causing damage that may be detrimental during transfusion. We’ve compared storage of red cells from frequent donors to red cells from less frequent donors to find out whether iron deficiency plays a part. We found the opposite to what we expected: red cells from donors with high iron levels may not store as well as those from “average” donors.

Researchers at Lifeblood track the appearance of new diseases by testing samples from across Australia. In recent years, they’ve monitored Zika, Chikungunya, hepatitis E, Dengue fever, Q-fever and Babesia viruses. Their studies provide information to help us select healthy donors and decide when to introduce new tests.
